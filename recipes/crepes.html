    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>crepe, also spelled crêpe, French pancake made of a thin batter containing flour, eggs, <br> 
    melted butter, salt, milk, water, and, if the crepes are to be served with a sweet sauce or <br> 
    garnish, sugar. Crepes can be filled with a variety of sweet or savoury mixtures. For crepes <br> 
    suzette the crepes are folded in four and soaked in a syrup flavoured with orange liqueur, and <br> 
    frequently are flamed at table. The word crêpe is derived from crispa, Latin for “curly.”</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>½ cup milk</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and the eggs. Gradually add in the milk <br> 
        and water, stirring to combine. Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth.</li>
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter <br> 
        onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion <br> 
        so that the batter coats the surface evenly.</li>
        <li>Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. Loosen with a spatula, turn <br> 
        and cook the other side. Serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
