    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Ratatouille (pronounced rat-uh-TOO-ee) is a very healthy and low fat summer
        vegetable stew.  It is a great way to use up the abundant roundup of fresh
        summer vegetables from the garden.  The perfection of ratatouille lies in the
        simplicity of the wholesome and fresh ingredients.  It can be enjoyed as a
        main dish served over rice with some good crusty bread or you can enjoy as 
        a side dish with a meat or fish entree.  The most common ingredients for 
        this stew are onions, garlic, zucchini, eggplant, bell peppers, and tomatoes.  
        You could also add in additional vegetables from your garden to enjoy in this 
        stew.</p>
